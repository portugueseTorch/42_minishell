The grammar below is written in Backus-Naur Form (BNF) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form

validInput	::=	pipeline

pipeline	::=	command
			|	pipeline "|" command

command		::=	word
			|	redirection
			|	heredoc
			|	command word
			|	command redirection

redirection	::= redir_oper file

redir_oper	::=	"<" | ">" | ">>"

heredoc		::= "<<" terminator

The symbology above can be easily explained if we follow a bottom-up approach, starting with the individual definitions.
- Heredoc is the use of "<<" followed by a termiator
- A word is any string correctly quoted
- A redirection is considered the use of "<", ">", or ">>" followed by a filename

Having the basic definitions understood we can start getting into the recursive definitionsw of the other parts.
- A command can be comprised of a single word ("ls"), redirection ("> test.txt"), or a heredoc ("<< EOF"). Additionally,
	a command can also be defined as a series words, redirections, or a combination of both ("ls -l > out.txt").
- A pipeline can be defined as a single command (as defined above), or as a series of commands concatenated by a "|"
